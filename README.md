## Getting Started

### Installing the dependencies

First and foremost, installed the dependencies which are required to run and build the projects.

The project currently uses bun to install dependencies, hence the bun lock file. However you can use `yarn` as well as `node` to run the application and it will just work fine.

Run the following commands to run the server
**If you're using bunjs**

```bash
# bun
bun install
```

**If you're using npm/nodejs**

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

**If you're using yarn**

```bash
# yarn
yarn
# or
yarn install
```

**If you're using pnpm**

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm install
```

### Running on development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Building the project

```bash
bun run build
```
